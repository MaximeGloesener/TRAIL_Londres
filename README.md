# Image Metrics Explanation

This README explains the image metrics used in our analysis.

## Metrics Overview

We use four primary metrics to analyze our images:

1. Mean
2. Standard Deviation (std)
3. Contrast
4. Entropy

### Mean

- Definition: The average intensity value of all pixels in the image.
- Significance: Provides a general idea of how bright or dark the image is overall.

### Standard Deviation (std)

- Definition: A measure of how much the pixel intensities vary or deviate from the mean.
- Significance: Higher std indicates more variation in pixel intensities, generally implying more contrast in the image.

### Contrast

- Definition: The difference between the highest and lowest pixel intensities in the image.
- Significance: Higher contrast generally means a clearer distinction between different parts of the image.

### Entropy

- Definition: A measure of randomness or unpredictability in the image.
- Significance: In image processing, it often relates to the amount of information or detail in an image. Higher entropy usually indicates more complex or detailed images.

## Interpretation

These metrics are useful for:

1. Comparing different images or versions of the same image.
2. Assessing the effects of image processing techniques.
3. Characterizing image quality or content.
